# Guinea-Pig

### This assignment accomplishes various event listener tasks in vanilla JavaScript:

- When any section is clicked the output target text should be "You clicked on the {text of the section} section"
- When the mouse is over the h1 tag, the output element should contain the text "You moved your mouse over the header".
- When the mouse leaves the h1 tag, the output element should contain the text "You left me!!".
- When you type characters into the input field, the output element should mirror the text in the input field.
- When you click the "Add color" button, the guinea-pig element's text color should change to blue.
- When you click the "Hulkify" button, the guinea-pig element's font size should become much larger.
- When you click the "Capture it" button, the guinea-pig element should have a border added to it.
- When you click the "Rounded" button, the guinea-pig element's border should become rounded.
- The first section's text should be bold.
- The last section's text should be bold and italicized.
- Make the buttons stop appearing next to each other as inline elements. Change them into block elements.
